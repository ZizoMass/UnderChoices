  - Heyo there Moleque! Still at the doctor's office.
  - This stuff that's been posted lately is real depressing lately, so I'm hoping
    I'll get to see ya soon.
  - The doctor is saying I'm fine, but they wanna have me back in in a few days for
    some blood tests.
  - Don't worry, they say it's just to make sure I'm in tip top shape. Loves ya!
